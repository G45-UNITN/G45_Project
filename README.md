You may also see any lint errors in the console.


## Locate in the */backend* folder:
### `nodemon server.js` or `npm start server.js`

When you run nodemon server.js, you are telling nodemon to start your Node.js server using the server.js file, and it will keep an eye on all files in the current directory and subdirectories for any changes. If it detects any modifications to your code, such as changes to JavaScript files, it will automatically restart the server so that you can see the changes without having to manually stop and restart the server each time you make a change.
